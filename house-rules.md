## Game Rules - Applies to all games

1. **Rule of cool**.  Creative interpretations of rules can be accepted, as long as it's for positive fun and not detriment to other players
2. Creative **shenanigans are welcome** and potentially rewarded even if they don't pan out 
3. **You are responsible for knowing the rules** and limitations of your abilities and spells
4. I am not a super experienced DM that has all the rules memorized.  **Please help** me out.
5. **We all have responsibility to make the game fun and inclusive for all**

## Combat

- **No silvery barbs**
- **Flanking Rules:**  +2 to attack rolls from flanking.  Flanking only works if you are in melee and two party members are on opposite sides of each other.
- **Nat 1s or multiple misses**:  these are opportunities for creative role-play.  It doesn't need to be just "miss" it could an epic battle of parries, etc.  Creative role-play of misses can result in awards like DM inspiration.
- **Familiars** roll their own initiatives (automated by Avrae)

- **Special Actions**: 

    - **Study Action**: 
        - If your character is unfamiliar with the enemy, you can use an attack action to study the enemy for characteristics, potential weaknesses, etc. 
        - Study for General Knowledge of the enemy:  Nature or Arcana check (as applicable) vs. DC15
        - Study for potential weaknesses:  INT check vs. [15, or 10 + CR of the enemy, whichever is greater]

    **Influence Action**:  use an attack action to try to influence a combatant's behavior (e.g. calm down, or focus attention on another combatant, etc.).  CHA check vs [15, or 10+ CR of the enemy, whichever is greater].  The action cannot force a creature to act against its nature, and depending on the intent and context, multiple passes may be required for influence to be successful. 

## PBP Specific Rules

- Role play is important.  This is what PBP is about.
- Must post at least once every 24 hours - so that the DM knows we can move on
- Unless otherwise stated in the game listing  characters soft-locked.  This means I will write down your stats when we start.  You can play in other games while this PBP is going on, but any XP, items, etc. from outside of the game won't be brought into this game during this PBP) 
- If I @you, it means we need your participation to move on BUT it does not mean we need your participation immediately  Please do not feel pressure to respond immediately if you're not able to (unless rule #2 is broken)
- I will be using Avrae for battle maps and initiative tracking, but learning avrae commands is completely optional.  Manual rolling is completely fine.
