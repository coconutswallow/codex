## Kalaman Quest Board

Gaining reputation in Kalaman allows you to gain influence or support from the various factions in Kalaman that could benefit your party, the citizens of Vogler/Kalaman, or both. Spend Reputation Points to unlock side-quests. Note that unlocking a side quest does not automatically mean benefits are achieved - each quest involves 1-2 scenes that require role-play and skills challenge(s) to receive the benefit.

## Earning Reputation Points
- Your starting Reputation Points is equal to the number of villagers saved in Act 2 Invasion.
- There are 4 major missions in this Act. Each act earns 10 Reputation Points when you complete a mission.
- Additional Bonuses can be earned:
    - **Strategic Victory (+2):** No NPC lost, all characters emerge from the battle > 85% HP.
    - **Overcoming Overwhelming Odds (+4):** All PCs have < 20% HP at the end of the battle.
    - **Heroic role playing:** (as awarded by the DM).
    - **Loss of Vogler NPCs:** -1 to -3 (if applicable to the mission).
    - **Death of a named NPC:** -4.
